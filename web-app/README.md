### Backend

In the beginning, this is going to be an application without login. All the information is publicly available. We might add authentication/authorization in the future if we want to restrict access to some information.

We are going to use an in-process analytical SQL database for the browser, [DuckDB-Wasm](https://duckdb.org), with a web assembly engine so no need for any kind of backend API because the queries will be executed directly within the web browser.
